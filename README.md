# info6205_Final
Genetic Algorithm is a method to search the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution process.

Game of  Life is a cellular automation which imposes fixed rules on the cells and “played” on an infinite two-dimensional discrete grid. Its successive generations are dependent only on the previous generation.

In our project, we use Genetic Algorithm to find the best pattern. Then using this pattern as an input to start our game of life(20*20). After successive generations, we try to find a stable pattern so that the game will last forever.

Note: 

1. It may take you at least eight minutes to get the result.
2. If you get an error of log4j when you run the game, you need to configure the file at first.
(1) If you use Eclipse, you need to mark the src file as sources.
(2) If you use Intellij IDEA, do the following steps: Project Settings -> Modules -> Sources -> Click on src file -> Mark as sources
