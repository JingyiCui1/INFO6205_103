Genetic Algorithm is a method to search the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution process.

Game of  Life is a cellular automation which imposes fixed rules on the cells and “played” on an infinite two-dimensional discrete grid. Its successive generations are dependent only on the previous generation.

In our project, we use Genetic Algorithm to find the best pattern. Then using this pattern as an input to start our game of life(20*20). After successive generations, we try to find a stable pattern so that the game will last forever.

Note: It may take you at least eight minutes to get the result.
